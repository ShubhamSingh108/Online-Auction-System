        If you're looking for live auctions, Quick-Auction is the place to go. 
        These live auctions are events that you can view right from your web browser to bid for items online at the same time as other bidders on the auction floor.

        With live bidding, you can access auctions around the world and get in on all the action without any software to download or special tools to buy. The website lists auctions that are currently live and ones that are upcoming.

        After you register to bid, you go straight to an auction to watch what's happening and bid in real-time if you see something you like.
